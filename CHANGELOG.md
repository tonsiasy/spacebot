**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacebot/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1

## v0.2.0

- Tag: `v0.2.0`
- Published: 2026-02-26T08:16:48Z
- URL: https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacebot/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## v0.2.0 is the _biggest_ Spacebot release yet. 

The agent is no longer a single-channel chatbot, it's a multi-agent system with real orchestration primitives.

<img width="1074" height="655" alt="Screenshot_2026-02-23_at_12 48 29_PM copy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04b4e72d-c646-4900-8096-eec7e5222ed6" />

Agents coordinate through a spec-driven task system with a full kanban board in the UI. Tasks are structured markdown documents with requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. The cortex background loop picks up ready tasks, spawns workers, and handles completion or re-queuing on failure. Agents see the shared task board through the bulletin system, so delegation happens through specs, not conversation.

Workers got a complete visibility overhaul. Full transcript persistence with gzip compression, live SSE streaming of tool calls as they happen, and a new worker_inspect tool so branches can verify what a worker actually did instead of trusting a one-line summary.

On the security front, the old string-based command filtering (215+ lines of whack-a-mole regex) has been replaced with kernel-enforced filesystem sandboxing via bubblewrap on Linux and sandbox-exec on macOS. The LLM can't write outside the workspace because the OS won't let it.

This release also brings OpenAI and Anthropic subscription auth support, better channel history preservation with deterministic retrigger handling, structured text payload blocking to keep raw JSON/XML out of user-facing messages, self-hosted update controls in the settings UI, new provider support (Kilo Gateway, OpenCode Go), prebuilt Linux binaries for amd64/arm64, a Nix flake, and a pile of fixes across cron scheduling, OAuth, model routing, and more.
