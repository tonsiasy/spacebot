# AGENTS.md

Implementation guide for coding agents working on Spacebot. Read `RUST_STYLE_GUIDE.md` before writing any code.

## What Spacebot Is

A Rust agentic system where every LLM process has a dedicated role and delegation is the only way work gets done. It replaces the monolithic session model (one LLM thread doing conversation + thinking + tool execution + memory retrieval + compaction) with specialized processes that only do one thing.

Single binary. No server dependencies. Runs on tokio. All data lives in embedded databases in a local data directory.

**Stack:** Rust (edition 2024), tokio, Rig (v0.30.0, agentic loop framework), SQLite (sqlx), LanceDB (embedded vector + FTS), redb (embedded key-value).

## JavaScript Tooling (Critical)

- For UI work in `spacebot/interface/`, use `bun` for all JS/TS package management and scripts.
- **NEVER** use `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn` in this repo unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- Standard commands:
  - `bun install`
  - `bun run dev`
  - `bun run build`
  - `bun run test`
  - `bunx <tool>` (instead of `npx <tool>`)

## Migration Safety

- **NEVER edit an existing migration file in place** once it has been committed or applied in any environment.
- Treat migration files as immutable; modifying historical migrations causes checksum mismatches and can block startup.
- For schema changes, always create a new migration with a new timestamp/version.

## Delivery Gates (Mandatory)

Run these checks in this order for code changes before pushing or updating a PR:

1. `just preflight` — validate git/remote/auth state and avoid push-loop churn.
2. `just gate-pr` — enforce formatting, compile checks, migration safety, lib tests, and integration test compile.

If `just` is unavailable, run the equivalent scripts directly in the same order: `./scripts/preflight.sh` then `./scripts/gate-pr.sh`.

Additional rules:

- If the same command fails twice in one session, stop rerunning it blindly. Capture root cause and switch strategy.
- For every external review finding marked P1/P2, add a targeted verification command in the final handoff.
- For changes in async/stateful paths (worker lifecycle, cancellation, retrigger, recall cache behavior), include explicit race/terminal-state reasoning in the PR summary and run targeted tests in addition to `just gate-pr`.
- Do not push if any gate is red.

## Architecture Overview

Five process types. Every LLM process is a Rig `Agent<SpacebotModel, SpacebotHook>`. They differ in system prompt, tools, history, and hooks.

### Channels

The user-facing LLM process. One per conversation (Telegram DM, Discord thread, etc). Has soul, identity, personality. Talks to the user. Delegates everything else.

A channel does NOT: execute tasks directly, search memories itself, do heavy tool work.

The channel is always responsive — never blocked by work, never frozen by compaction. When it needs to think, it branches. When it needs work done, it spawns a worker. When context gets full, the compactor has already handled it.

**Tools:** reply, branch, spawn_worker, route, cancel, skip, react  
**Context:** Conversation history + compaction summaries + status block  
**History:** Persistent `Vec<Message>`, passed via `agent.prompt().with_history(&mut history)`

### Branches

A fork of the channel's context that goes off to think. Has the channel's full conversation history — same context, same memories, same understanding. Operates independently. The channel never sees the working, only the conclusion.

Creating a branch is `let branch_history = channel_history.clone()`.

The branch result is injected into the channel's history as a distinct message type. Then the branch is deleted. Multiple branches can run concurrently per channel (configurable limit). First done, first incorporated.

**Tools:** memory_recall, memory_save, memory_delete, channel_recall, spacebot_docs, task_create, task_list, task_update, spawn_worker  
**Context:** Clone of channel history at fork time  
**Lifecycle:** Short-lived. Returns a conclusion, then deleted.

### Workers

Independent process that does a job. Gets a specific task, a focused system prompt, and task-appropriate tools. No channel context, no soul, no personality.

Two kinds:
- **Fire-and-forget:** Does a job and returns a result. Memory recall, summarization, one-shot tasks.
- **Interactive:** Long-running, accepts follow-up input from the channel. Coding sessions, complex multi-step tasks.

Workers are pluggable. A worker can be:
- A Rig agent with shell/file/exec tools
- An OpenCode subprocess
- Any external process that accepts a task and reports status

**Tools:** shell, file, exec, set_status (varies by worker type)  
**Context:** Fresh prompt + task description. No channel history.  
**Lifecycle:** Fire-and-forget or long-running. Reports status via `set_status` tool.

### The Compactor

NOT an LLM process. A programmatic monitor per channel. Watches context size and triggers compaction before the channel fills up.

Tiered thresholds:
- **>80%** — background compaction worker (summarize + extract memories)
- **>85%** — aggressive summarization
- **>95%** — emergency truncation (no LLM, just drop oldest turns)

The compaction worker runs alongside the channel without blocking it. Compacted summaries stack at the top of the context window.

### The Cortex

System-level observer. Primary job: generate the **memory bulletin** — a periodically refreshed, LLM-curated summary of the agent's current knowledge. Runs on a configurable interval (default 60 min), uses `memory_recall` to query across multiple dimensions (identity, events, decisions, preferences), synthesizes into a ~500 word briefing cached in `RuntimeConfig::memory_bulletin`. Every channel reads this on every turn via `ArcSwap`.

Also observes system-wide signals for future health monitoring and memory consolidation.

**Tools (bulletin generation):** memory_recall, memory_save  
**Tools (interactive cortex chat):** memory + worker tools, `spacebot_docs`, `config_inspect`, task board tools  
**Tools (future health monitoring):** memory_consolidate, system_monitor  
**Context:** Fresh per bulletin run. No compaction needed.

### Status Injection

Every turn, the channel gets a live status block injected into its context — active workers, recently completed work, branch states. Workers set their own status via `set_status` tool. Short branches are invisible (only appear if running >3s).

### Cron Jobs

Database-stored scheduled tasks. Each cron job has a prompt, interval, delivery target, and optional active hours. When a timer fires, it gets a fresh short-lived channel with full branching and worker capabilities. Multiple cron jobs run independently and concurrently.

```

Module roots (e.g., `src/memory.rs`) contain `mod` declarations and re-exports. Never create `mod.rs` files.

Tools are organized by function, not by consumer. Which processes get which tools is configured via factory functions in `tools.rs`.

## Three Databases

Each doing what it's best at. No server processes.

**SQLite** (via sqlx) — relational data: conversations, memory graph, cron jobs. Queries with joins, ordering, filtering. Migrations in `migrations/`.

**LanceDB** — vector/search data: embeddings (HNSW), full-text search (Tantivy), hybrid search (RRF). Joined to SQLite on memory ID.

**redb** — key-value config: settings, encrypted secrets. Separate from SQLite so config can be backed up independently.

Actual queries live in the modules that use them — `memory/store.rs` has graph queries, `memory/lance.rs` has search, `conversation/history.rs` has conversation queries. The `db/` module is just connection setup and migration running.

## Memory System

Memories are structured objects, not files. Every memory is a row in SQLite with typed metadata and graph connections, paired with a vector embedding in LanceDB.

**Types:** Fact, Preference, Decision, Identity, Event, Observation.

**Graph edges:** RelatedTo, Updates, Contradicts, CausedBy, PartOf. Auto-associated on creation via similarity search. >0.9 similarity marks as `Updates`.

**Three creation paths:**
1. Branch-initiated (during conversation) — branch uses `memory_save` tool
2. Compactor-initiated (during compaction) — extract memories from context being compacted
3. Cortex-initiated (system-level) — consolidation, observations

**Recall flow:** Branch → recall tool → hybrid search (vector + FTS + RRF + graph traversal) → curate → return clean results. The channel never sees raw search results.

**Importance:** Score 0-1. Influenced by explicit importance, access frequency, recency, graph centrality. Identity memories exempt from decay.

**Identity files** (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md) are loaded from disk into system prompts. They are NOT graph memories.

## Rig Integration

Every LLM process is a Rig `Agent`. Key patterns:

**Agent construction:**
```rust
let agent = AgentBuilder::new(model.clone())
    .preamble(&system_prompt)
    .hook(SpacebotHook::new(process_id, process_type, event_tx.clone()))
    .tool_server_handle(tools.clone())
    .default_max_turns(50)
    .build();
```

**History is external**, passed on each call:
```rust
let response = agent.prompt(&user_message)
    .with_history(&mut history)
    .max_turns(5)
    .await?;
```

**Branching is a clone:**
```rust
let branch_history = channel_history.clone();
```

**Custom CompletionModel** — `SpacebotModel` routes through `LlmManager`. We don't use Rig's built-in provider clients.

**PromptHook** — `SpacebotHook` sends `ProcessEvent`s for status reporting, usage tracking, cancellation. Returns `Continue`, `Terminate`, or `Skip`.

**ToolServer topology:**
- Per-channel `ToolServer` (no memory tools, just channel action tools added per turn)
- Per-branch `ToolServer` with memory tools (memory_save, memory_recall, memory_delete), channel recall, docs introspection (`spacebot_docs`), and task-board tools
- Per-worker `ToolServer` with task-specific tools (shell, file, exec)
- Per-cortex `ToolServer` with memory_save

**Max turns:** Rig defaults to 0 (single call). Always set explicitly.
- Workers: `max_turns(50)` — many iterations
- Branches: `max_turns(10)` — a few iterations
- Channels: `max_turns(5)` — typically 1-3 turns

**Error recovery:** Rig returns chat history in `MaxTurnsError` and `PromptCancelled`. Use this for worker timeout, cancellation, budget enforcement.

**We don't use:** Rig's built-in provider clients, RAG/vector store integrations, Agent-as-Tool, Pipeline system.

4. Workspace path guards (reject writes to identity/memory paths)
5. Circuit breaker for cron jobs and background tasks

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't block the channel.** The channel never waits on branches, workers, or compaction. If you're writing code where the channel awaits a branch result before responding, the design is wrong.

**Don't dump raw search results into channel context.** Memory recall goes through a branch, which curates. The channel gets clean conclusions, not 50 raw database rows.

**Don't give workers channel context.** Workers get a fresh prompt and a task. If a worker needs conversation context, that's a branch, not a worker.

**Don't make the compactor an LLM process.** The compactor is programmatic — it watches a number (context token count) and spawns workers. The LLM work happens in the compaction worker it spawns.

**Don't store prompts as string constants in Rust.** System prompts live in `prompts/` as markdown files. Load at startup or on demand.

**Don't create `mod.rs` files.** Use `src/memory.rs` as the module root, not `src/memory/mod.rs`.

**Don't silently discard errors.** No `let _ =` on Results. Handle them, log them, or propagate them. The only exception is `.ok()` on channel sends where the receiver may be dropped.

**Don't use `#[async_trait]`.** Use native RPITIT for async traits. Only add a companion `Dyn` trait when you actually need `dyn Trait`.

**Don't create many small files.** Implement functionality in existing files unless it's a new logical component.

**Don't abbreviate variable names.** `queue` not `q`, `message` not `msg`, `channel` not `ch`. Common abbreviations like `config` are fine.

**Don't add new features without updating existing docs.** When a feature change affects user-facing configuration, behaviour, or architecture, update the relevant existing documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`) in the same commit or PR. Don't create new doc files for this — update what's already there.

## Patterns to Implement

These are validated patterns from research (see `docs/research/pattern-analysis.md`). Implement them when building the relevant module.

**Tool nudging:** When an LLM responds with text instead of tool calls in the first 2 iterations, inject "Please proceed and use the available tools." Implement in `SpacebotHook.on_completion_response()`. Workers benefit most.

**Fire-and-forget DB writes:** `tokio::spawn` for conversation history saves, memory writes, worker log persistence. User gets their response immediately.

**Tiered compaction:** >80% background, >85% aggressive, >95% emergency truncation. The compactor uses these thresholds.

**Hybrid search with RRF:** Vector similarity + full-text search, merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (`score = sum(1/(60 + rank))`). RRF works on ranks, not raw scores.

**Leak detection:** Regex patterns for API keys, tokens, PEM keys. Scan in `SpacebotHook.on_tool_result()` (after execution) and before outbound HTTP (block exfiltration).

**Workspace path guard:** File tools reject writes to identity/memory paths with an error directing the LLM to the correct tool.

**Circuit breaker:** Auto-disable recurring tasks after 3 consecutive failures. Apply to cron jobs, maintenance workers, cortex routines.

**Config resolution:** `env > DB > default` with per-subsystem `resolve()` methods.

**Error-as-result for tools:** Tool errors are returned as structured results, not panics. The LLM sees the error and can recover.

**Worker state machine:** Validate transitions with `can_transition_to()` using `matches!`. Illegal transitions are runtime errors, not silent bugs.
